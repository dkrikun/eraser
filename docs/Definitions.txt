1. Concept definitons in the context of JVM

1.1 Thread
According to vm 8.1.2, creating a Thread object creates a thread, and that is the only way to create a thread.
When the thread is created, it is not yet active; it begins to run when its start method is called.

1.2 Shared variable
Shared variable is a variable that can be accessed by more than one thread concurrently.
Thread-local (or local, when the context is clear) variable is a variable that is not shared.
The only runtime data area used for the storage of shared variables is heap (vm 3.5.3).
Considering the kind of variable (as defined in vm 2.5), shared variables can be of the following kinds only:
        1. class variable
        2. instance variable
        3. array element

1.3 Read/write access instructions
getstatic/putstatic
        are the only instructions used for read/write access (respectively) to a class variable.
getfield/putfield
        are the only instructions used for read/write access (respectively) to an instance variable.
baload, caload, saload, iaload, laload, faload, daload, aaload
        are the only instrucltions for read access to an array component.
bastore, castore, sastore, iastore, lastore, fastore, dastore, aastore
        are the only instructions for write access to an array component.
